# Changelog

## [0.0.4] - 2026-07-27

- Renamed the extension to "Spotify Player for VSCode".
- Use the editor's own UI font (`--vscode-font-family`/`-size`/`-weight`) instead of the bundled pixel fonts; the `Jersey10`/`Micro5` `.ttf` assets are gone.
- New repeat button, cycling off → repeat all → repeat one.
- Previous button now restarts the current track when more than 3s in, like a normal music app.
